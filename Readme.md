# <u> `Problem Statement ` :mag: </u>

**India is rich in diversity whether cultural or climatic. Rain is a mandatory phenomenon for us as most of our land is agricultural. Farmers and fishermen are our heroes as they provide us with the necessities for survival. But due to unpredictable rain cycles, most of the farmlands get damaged as the farmers are not ready to handle the untimely rain. Even many fishermen lose their lives as they fail to predict the rains beforehand.We can't lose our food providers to unpredictable climatic changes.**

<br>

# <u> `Project Overview` :star2: </u>

**Our project tries to solve this issue by providing a way to predict the rains for the next day.The prediction is based on the location and the historical trends of rainfall of that area.<br>**

# <u> `How it Works` ðŸ’¡</u>

**Our face recognition application basically works in two phases -** <br>

**:seedling: The registration phase - Each student needs to enter his/her name and unique ID and press the 'Add New User' button. The camera module turns on and captures the face of the student and saves it in the database along with the name and ID. For each student, 49 pictures are captured by the camera module so that no erroneous attendance is recorded.**<br>

**:seedling: Once the registration phase is over, the system gets fully trained to take attendance. Each student present just needs to sit in front of the camera module and press the 'Take Attendance' button. The camera module searches for the student's face in the stored database and reflects the attendance with the name, ID and time in less than 5 seconds.**
